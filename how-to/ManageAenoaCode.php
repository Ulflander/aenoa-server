	File: How to manage Aenoa code
	
	Aenoa Systems has many repositories to maintain the code.
	
	
	Requirements:
	
	- You need git (http://git-scm.com/) installed on your local machine in order to work on Webkupi code.
	
	Code repositories:
	
	Aenoa frameworks private repositories are hosted at
	> 188.165.206.186
	
	Public repositories are hosted on github
	> https://github.com/aenoa
	
	Aenoa Repositories (188.165.206.186):
	
	Aenoa Javascript Framework: /hyperspace/git/ajsf
	Aenoa CSS Framework: /hyperspace/git/ac
	Aenoa Server: /hyperspace/git/ajsf
	Natural Docs Aenoa fork : /hyperspace/git/nsdocsfork
	
	Getting the code:
	
	First clone the repository from Aenoa Systems server.
	> git clone USER@188.165.206.186:/hyperspace/git/ajsf
	This command will create a new folder named *ajsf* in which you'll find corresponding code.
	You have to replace the *USER* token by your own username
	
	Updating the code in repositories:
	
	Develop what you have to, add files (don't forget to use the "git add" command), then commit your code using the following commands	
	> cd backend
	> git commit -am 'Commit message'
	> git push origin master
	
	Getting the passwords for repositories and servers:
	For the moment, send an email to Xavier Laumonier <contact@aenoa-systems.com> to get a user/password set to connect to repositories.
